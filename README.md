## Usage

### Upload Invoice

To upload an invoice, send a POST request to `/upload_invoice/`, providing the invoice file as form data.

Example:

```
curl -X 'POST'
'http://localhost:8000/upload_invoice/'
-H 'accept: application/json'
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'
-F 'invoice=@/path/to/invoice.pdf'
```

### Ask Question

To ask a question about the processed data, send a POST request to `/ask_question/`, providing the question as form data. Optionally, you can enable semantic search by setting the `semantic_search` parameter to `true`.

Example:
```
curl -X 'POST'
'http://localhost:8000/ask_question/'
-H 'accept: application/json'
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-d '{
"question": "What is the total amount?",
"semantic_search": true
}'
```

## Configuration

The configuration for the service is stored in `config.yml`. You can modify this file to adjust various parameters such as data paths, model settings, and more.
